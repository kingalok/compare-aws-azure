| Group | AWS Component | Azure Component | Differences | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Virtual Network | VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) | VNet (Virtual Network) | VPCs are region-specific, and peering is needed for communication across regions. VNets are global and can communicate across regions without peering. | Used to logically isolate resources in the cloud and provide networking to your cloud resources. |
| Subnetwork | Subnet | Subnet | AWS Subnets are tied to a single Availability Zone (AZ). Azure subnets are not tied to an AZ and span all AZs in the region. | Used to further segment the network within a VPC or VNet. |
| Security | Security Group | Network Security Group (NSG) | Both work as a virtual firewall for associated resources. In AWS, rules are stateful. Azure NSG rules are stateless but can be made stateful by combining with Application Security Groups. | Provide security at the protocol and port access level. |
| Access Control | NACL (Network Access Control List) | NSG | NACLs operate at the subnet level, are stateless, and automatically apply to all instances in the subnet. Azure uses NSGs, which can operate at the subnet or NIC level and are stateful. | Provide an additional layer of security, acting as a firewall at the subnet level. |
| DNS Services | Route 53 | Azure DNS | Both provide highly reliable and cost-effective domain name registration, DNS routing, and health checking of resources. Route 53 also offers domain registration, while Azure users need to use a third-party for domain registration. | Manage DNS records and domain names. |
| Load Balancing | ELB (Classic Load Balancer)<br>ALB (Application Load Balancer)<br>NLB (Network Load Balancer) | Azure Load Balancer (for network level)<br>Azure Application Gateway (for application level) | Azure Load Balancer is similar to AWS ELB/NLB, working at transport level (TCP/UDP). Azure Application Gateway is similar to AWS ALB, working at application level (HTTP/HTTPS). | Distribute network traffic across multiple resources and provide layer 7 load balancing. |
| Content Delivery | CloudFront | Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) | Both offer a content delivery network to deliver content with low latency. AWS CloudFront has a broader global presence. Azure CDN offers multiple product options (Microsoft, Verizon, Akamai) with different capabilities and pricing. | Speed up distribution of files and web content to users around the world. |
| Private Connection | Direct Connect | ExpressRoute | Both offer a private, dedicated network connection from on-premises to the cloud. Direct Connect uses a partner network to connect, while ExpressRoute can use an Exchange Provider or Network Service Provider for connectivity. | Provide more reliable, consistent network performance than internet-based connections. |
| Service Connection | VPC Endpoints | Service Endpoints | VPC Endpoints (AWS) allow private connectivity to services in your VPC. Service Endpoints (Azure) provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route. | Improve security by enabling private network connections between your network and cloud services. |
| Network Peering | VPC Peering | VNet Peering | Both allow networking connection between two networks. In AWS, peering relationships are non-transitive. Azure supports both peering (non-transitive) and virtual network peering (transitive). | Enable seamless connectivity between networks through private IP addresses. |
| Network Address Translation | NAT Gateway | NAT Gateway | Both allow instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. Azure also has a NAT function as part of its load balancer. | Provide a way for instances in a private subnet to connect out to the internet without exposing them to inbound internet connections. |
| Traffic Management | Route 53 | Traffic Manager | Both allow routing of incoming traffic based on various policies. AWS uses Route 53, while Azure uses Traffic Manager. | To balance incoming traffic and failover. |
| Web Security | AWS WAF | Azure WAF | Both provide web application firewalls that help protect web applications from common web exploits. | To safeguard web applications from various threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. |
| DDoS Protection | AWS Shield | Azure DDoS Protection | Both provide services to protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. | To protect applications from DDoS attacks. |
| Edge Network | AWS Global Accelerator | Azure Front Door | Both provide a service to improve the availability and performance of the applications to the users. AWS uses Global Accelerator, while Azure uses Front Door. | Accelerate application delivery. |
| VPN Connection | AWS VPN Gateway | Azure VPN Gateway | Both provide secure, private connectivity between your on-premises network and your VPCs/VNets. Azure VPN Gateway supports more tunnels per VPN Gateway compared to AWS VPN Gateway. | Connect on-premises network to cloud network. |
| Route Tables | Route Tables | Route Tables | AWS route tables are associated with VPC and subnets. Azure route tables are created separately and then associated with subnets. | Control the routing for outbound network traffic. |
| Network Traffic Logging | VPC Flow Logs | NSG Flow Logs | AWS VPC Flow Logs capture information about IP traffic going in and out of network interfaces in a VPC. Azure NSG Flow Logs capture information about inbound and outbound traffic on the Network Security Group level. | Enable capture and inspection of network traffic for monitoring, troubleshooting, threat detection, and forensics. |
| Private Connection to Services | PrivateLink | Private Link | AWS PrivateLink allows AWS services to be exposed on local VPC addresses. Azure Private Link maps services behind a private IP in your VNet. | Enable access to certain cloud services over a private endpoint within your virtual network. |
